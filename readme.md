Casa Martelli is our family home in Abruzzo, Italy. It's an happy place located in the historic centre of a little town. Everthing about our house is always a work in progress so expect a lot of updates to this repo.

### Why do we automate?

Automations in our house are there to help us reduce the number of repetitive tasks so we can focus on more important things.

### Approach to automations

Our automations should adapt to us, not the opposite, they are there to add value to the interactions we have with our living space.

A great article by Paulus Schoutsen can be found [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2016/01/19/perfect-home-automation/).

## Software
